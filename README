These scripts are a collection of utilities we've written here at 
Slide, Inc (http://www.slide.com) for improving our workflow with Git.

Some of the scripts are in active use, while others have since been 
deprecated (like davgit).

The "svnpull.sh" is a script that we've used to help run a "hybrid" of 
Git and Subversion at the same time while moving the company over to Git.

At a high level, svnpull.sh is purely responsible for mashing the non-linear
Git revision history down in a format that is digestable for Subversion. What
this means in more technical terms is that commits in Git that are merged into 
the "master" branch and pushed to the central repository will get propagated 
into the "trunk" branch in Subversion by way of "squashed commits"

For the reciprocal (Subversion-to-Git) we're using git-svn(1) in a relatively 
straight-forward manner, 

To tie these two ends (Subversion-to-Git, Git-to-Subversion) we're using some 
automated jobs set up in Hudson (http://hudson.dev.java.net). The first job 
(Subversion-to-Git) polls trunk every 5 minutes using Hudson's SCM integration,
if there are new changes in trunk the job will execute:
	% git-svn fetch && git merge git-svn && git push gitosis master

On the other side, we're running the Git-to-Subversion job whenever a committer 
pushes their changes up to the central Git master branch, this job executes:
	% svnpull.sh gitosis master ; git checkout master
